# Track-to-track association for collective perception based on Stochastic optimization

This is the code repository to the publication:
Wolf, Laura M., et al. "Track-to-Track Association for Collective Perception based on Stochastic Optimization." arXiv preprint [arXiv:2510.21278](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21278) (2025). 

The corresponding data set is available at https://doi.org/10.25625/8FQZZF.

## Notes:
- the absolute paths in `abspath.py` have to be adjusted.
- `batch_eval_t2ta` runs the Monte Carlo simulations.
- `batch_eval_artery` runs the simulations on artery data. 
- `euclid` refers to the Euclidean distance, `gl` to the generalized likelihood and `ml` to our proposed likelihood.
